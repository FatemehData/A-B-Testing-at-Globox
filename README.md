# GloBox A/B Test Analysis

## Overview
This project presents the findings of an A/B test conducted by GloBox on a food and drink landing page banner. The primary goal was to evaluate the banner's impact on user conversions and the average amount spent per user.

## Experiment Details
- **Objective:** To determine the effect of a new banner on the food and drink landing page on user conversion rates.
- **Methodology:** A/B testing was employed, comparing a test group (exposed to the banner) against a control group.
- **Duration:** Jan 25th - Feb 6th, 2023
- **Platforms:** Mobile (iOS and Android)
- **Regions Involved:** AUS, BRA, CAN, DEU, ESP, FRA, GBR, MEX, TUR, USA

## Key Findings
- The banner led to a significant increase in the user conversion rate.
- No significant change was observed in the average amount spent per user.
- Variations in conversion rates were noted across different user segments (device, gender, region).

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, it is advised not to proceed with a full-scale launch of this experiment. However, should there be interest in pursuing this, focus should be on optimizing the banner's design and placement, and developing tailored strategies for different user segments.
